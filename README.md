# general-purpose
Convenience repository to perform general-purpose tasks

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/michimichiamo/general-purpose/HEAD)

## Instructions
Just click on the above badge to build a [Docker image](https://www.docker.com) from the repository and launch an online [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) instance. You can create notebooks, launch Python shells, create script files etc: it works just like any other container. Feel free to play around!
Please note that the JupyterLab instance is **read-only**, since it is build from this repository: remember to save all your work (e.g. by downloading a `.py` version of the Jupyter notebook) before shutting down the instance.
